# CHALL5_SCHEDULEOFAWESOMENESS

## Starter code created a non-functional calendar with 3 example time blocks. User was wanting a fully functional calendar with a typical 9-5 work day where time capsules for each hour stored written messages to local storage. User wanted a color coating system where past, present, and future times showed in color so that they would know which tasks were which due to the color that coordinates with actual time of user device.

### Most of my difficulty on this project dealt with the time and getting adjusted to the jQuery methods to call classes and id's. Robbert, again, helped guide me and elaborated on code that I knew needed to be added that I didn't fully understand
